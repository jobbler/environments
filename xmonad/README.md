These are the scripts and configuration that I use in my xmonad desktop environment.

The following are how to use them:

bin		These files should be placed in ~/bin

monad		These file should be placed in ~/.xmonad

screenlayout	These files should be placed in ~/.screenlayout




The bin and screenlayout directories are my default locations for the files.
The locations can be changed by changing the appropriate files under monad and bin.

These files will need customization to work for another users preferences.
